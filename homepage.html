            <p>The populations of sea turtles vary species to species. Some sea turtles are fortunate to have quite prosperous populations, while others struggle with being critically engaged. 
                <br>
                <br>
                There are an estimated 1,030,000 nesting female sea turtles living in our oceans. If 90% of all sea turtles are female, the additional 10% of male sea turtles puts the total figure for sea turtles left in the world at around 1,133,000 - one-million, one-hundred and thirty-three thousand</p>

                    <h5>THE ORIGIN OF TURTLES</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Turtles are known to have originated around 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period, but what exactly they evolved from is still debated.

                    Some scientists argue that turtles are more closely related to lizards and snakes, while others believe that turtles should in fact be placed within the archosaurs, a group that contains crocodiles, pterosaurs, dinosaurs and birds. </p>

                    <h5>LIFE SPAN OF TURTLES</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>The average lifespan of a turtle or tortoise is highly dependent on the species. Some species may only live 10 to 20 years in captivity, while others can live up to 150 years. In general, most turtle and tortoise species can live well into their 50s if provided appropriate care.</p>

                    <h5>REPRODUCTION</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Nesting female sea turtles emerge from the Gulf of Mexico to lay their eggs on the beaches of the Gulf Islands from May to September. They use their hind flippers to dig a vase-shaped hole and then lay their eggs. Most species come ashore at night, alone, and during high tide, while some species nest during the day and emerge from the ocean in an arribada or arrival. </p>

                 <br>
                 <p>All species require specific daytime, nighttime, and basking temperatures that should be frequently monitored and adjusted as needed. Aquatic species water temperatures are typically in the 75-85°F range.</p>

                 <h5>Veterinary care</h5>
                 <br>
                 <p>All turtle and tortoise species require at least one veterinary exam per year for a full physical exam, weight check, husbandry review, and general health assessment. Fecal samples should be checked more often for signs of parasites. As turtles and tortoises age, routine bloodwork can help determine internal organ function and other signs of disease.</p>

                 <p>
                    All turtles and tortoises benefit from the opportunity to forage—searching, digging, or rooting for their favorite foods, treats, and toys. Foraging can help prevent boredom in captive turtles and tortoises and is most successful when mimicking a natural behavior.</p>
