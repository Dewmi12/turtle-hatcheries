            <p>Worldwide, six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened or endangered due to human actions and lifestyles. From getting caught in fishing gear to people eating their meat and eggs, there are lots of ways that these animals are affected by people</p>

            <h1> Threats from Harvest for Consumption</h1>
            <p><b>The Problem:</b> Although sea turtles have spiritual or mythological importance in many cultures around the world, this has not prevented humans from consuming their eggs or meat. In many coastal communities, especially in Central America and Asia, sea turtles are considered a food source. During the nesting season, hunters comb the beaches at night looking for nesting females. Often, they will wait until the female has deposited her eggs to kill her. Then, they take both the eggs and meat. In some countries, sea turtle eggs are prized as an aphrodisiac. Others customarily consume sea turtle meat in observance of religious holidays. For example, in Mexico, thousands of inland residents journey to Pacific coastal communities during the week preceding Easter in search of sea turtles and other seafood. During this short period of time, as many as 5,000 turtles are consumed in this region alone. Until the 1970s when sea turtles were internationally recognized as endangered, their meat was also used to prepare turtle soup- considered a specialty by Europeans. Additionally, people may use other parts of the turtle for products, including the oil, cartilage, skin and shell.</p>

            <p><b>Species Affected:</b> The most commonly eaten sea turtle meat comes from the green sea turtle. However, loggerheads, ridleys, and occasionally hawksbills and leatherbacks are also consumed by humans in various regions around the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The Solution:</b> In order to help combat the threat posed by human consumption, governments and conservationists have developed and tested several methods, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Education;</li>
                    <li>Patrolling nesting beaches;</li>
                    <li>Relocating eggs to hatcheries (only in areas where no other soluntion will work);</li>
                    <li>Ecotourism based on sea turtles;</li>
                    <li>Government-imposed limits on consumption.</li>

            <h1>Threats from Commercial Longline Fisheries</h1>
            <p><b>The Problem:</b> : Each year, sea turtles are accidentally captured, injured or killed by fishermen. Many of these injuries and deaths take place while turtles are migrating through fishing areas. The turtles, attracted to the bait, get caught on the hooks used to catch fish. A long line is a huge fishing line that can have thousands of hooks and lures and can stretch for several miles behind boats. Many of the fish that are being sought after live in the same areas as turtles. When a turtle is caught unintentionally the hook can kill them because it could prevent them from getting to the surface to get air. Furthermore, if they don’t die from drowning, the hook can be permanently debilitating because it can get lodged in their digestive systems and eventually cause a much slower death. As it stands, the global fishing fleet is currently 2.5 times larger than what oceans can sustainably support, which shows how big a threat commercial fishing practices pose to turtles. One study stated every year longliners set more than one billion baited hooks, clearly a practice that threatens the survival of sea turtles.
                <br>
                Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Fisheries Service (NMFS) announced an emergency rule to protect threatened sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico. The temporary rule, which took effect on May 18, will require the commercial reef fish longline fleet to fish seaward of a line approximating the 50-fathom contour in the Gulf of Mexico. Current regulations require this fleet to fish seaward of 20-fathoms. The ban comes after a NMFS report estimated that as many as 1,000 sea turtles were caught in the fishery over an 18 month period.

            <h1>Threats from Beach Erosion</h1>
            <p><b>The Problem:</b> : One way to address beach erosion is through beach nourishment. Nourishment consists of pumping, trucking or otherwise depositing sand on a beach to replace what has been lost to erosion. While beach nourishment is often preferable to armoring, it can negatively impact sea turtles if the sand is too compacted for turtles to nest in or if the sand imported is drastically different from native beach sediments, thereby potentially affecting nest-site selection, digging behavior, incubation temperature and the moisture content of nests. If renourishment is allowed to proceed during nesting season, nests can also be buried far beneath the surface or run over by heavy machinery.
                <br>
                Dredging can also cause direct threats to sea turtles and their nearshore marine habitats. Hopper dredges that suck up the sand from offshore have been directly responsible for the incidental capture and death of many sea turtles in the US. Also if the sand is too fine or silty it can wash back out and cover near shore rocky bottom habitats that are used by many marine species and sea turtles.
                However, when done correctly and in accordance with all laws to protect sea turtles and other natural resources, beach nourishment can add nesting habitat where erosion had washed it away. It is worth noting that a very wide beach resulting from nourishment is generally only beneficial to sea turtles in those areas where limited or degraded nesting habitat had previously existed.

            <h1> Threats from Marine Pollution</h1>
            <p><b>The Problem:</b>: Pollution can have serious impacts on both sea turtles and the food they eat. For example, new research suggests that a disease now killing many sea turtles (fibropapillomas) may be linked to pollution in the oceans and in nearshore waters. When pollution contaminates and kills aquatic plant and animal life, it also destroys feeding habitats for sea turtles. Oil spills and urban runoff of chemicals and fertilizers all contribute to water pollution. An estimated 36% of all marine pollution from oil comes through drains and rivers from cities.
                <br>
                Fertilizers are another huge marine pollutant. The runoff comes from farms and lawns, causing eutrophication from the extra nutrients. Eutrophication is an explosion of algal blooms that can deplete the water’s oxygen and suffocate marine life. Eutrophication has created enormous dead zones in many parts of the world, including the Gulf of Mexico. Improper sewage disposal is another factor that causes eutrophication.
                <br>
                Because the ocean is so large, many assume that pollutants will be diluted and dispersed to safe levels, but in reality they create havoc on the oceans’ natural balance. Some toxins even become more concentrated as they break down and enter the food chain. Sea turtles are affected by pollution in more ways than one; they do not have to directly ingest a tar ball, for example, to be affected by it. Small marine animals, on the lower levels in the food chain, like plankton, absorb these chemicals as they feed. The chemicals then accumulate in these animals’ bodies, which makes the toxins much more concentrated than in the surrounding water. These small animals are then consumed by larger animals, like sea turtles, which continues to increase concentration levels of chemicals and pollutants.
